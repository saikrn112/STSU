This is a fork of official code for "Structured Birdâ€™s-Eye-View Traffic Scene Understanding from Onboard Images" 

Original Code - https://github.com/ybarancan/STSU

In this work, we enhance the multi view lane line extraction represented in BEV coordinates using a multi view camera images instead of single camera image as in original work 


[Link to original paper](report.pdf)

All the instructions are exactly same as the one mentioned in the original paper. We enhanced the ground truth generation and additional encoder components to get multi view representation
